# Studylight-v1.0

StudyLight is a PFE project (Final-year project, or "Projet de Fin d’Etudes" in french) made by 5 students in their final year at ECE Paris Engineering School.

The purpose was to build a solar lamp for kids who lived in difficult conditions in order to allow them to study when there’s no more sun. For that, in the first time, we had to size our system by defining our constraints and needs of our future users. Besides, we had to make the electrical circuit and so define the different compounds needed for our project. And at the end, we made our lamp thanks to Solidworks by giving it a simple design and making each part of it put together separately. Kids will be able to build easily their lamps and so have a better understanding of the object they have made. The goal is to sensitize kids about the basics of electronics.
We also add to our project a pedagogical dimension. Indeed, we wanted to sensitize kids to renewable energies and electronics. For that, we created a comic book which will be provided with our solar lamp. It will aim at making understandable how solar energy and the supercapacitors work.

The goal of StudyLight is not only to give an access to the light to population in need but also to interest kids in the technologies which have a big future. Given the context and the market, we will soon have to prefer green energy over fossil fuels. As for supercapacitors, only the price may still slow down their development, but these are decreasing nowadays, making them more easily affordable and comforting us in our project choice.

The idea of a green energy lamp has nothing new. Many companies have already assaulted this market, such as Olux or Luminaid. Some prove original, like Gravity Light, that uses potential energy as a mean of storage, and HourGlass Lamp, that uses the energy of the sand flowing in an hourglass as a source of energy.
Therefore, given all that already exists, the added value to our project is the use of supercapacitors. Indeed, most solar lamps use batteries as a mean of storage. The choice of supercapacitors gives our lamp a longer lifespan and reduces the chance of overheating (that may cause explosion).
However, the true added value to our project is its pedagogical side. By joining a educative comic to our lamp, we relay our knowledge and therefore allow children to better understand how the device they are holding is working.

In the end, our product can be defined as:
- Pedagogical, through the comic,
- Efficient, through the supercapacitor,
- Transportable and easily manipulable thanks to the design we gave our lamp.
